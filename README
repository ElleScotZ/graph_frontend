FRONTEND SIDE OF GRAPH THEORY WEB APP.

About:

A university project I had to do. The topic was freely chosen, it just had to be a web-based
application. I chose to create an app that displays user-defined, directed, weighted graphs and
analyse them using "tools", such as shortest path, path with max X weight, etc. The idea was
fully mine, the backend side was written fully alone, the frontend was written with help. The
app was originally hosted on Google Cloud (set up also by me), but now only the source code
is available.
